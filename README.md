RUBY Online Coding Boot Camp Challenges
In these challenges, students worked with complex data structures to solidify object-oriented programming skills -- laying the foundation for a software engineering career. The challenges also gave students rigorous preparation needed for any technical interview.
ðŸ§® Quizzes #1 and #2
*Heroku Hosted Application
Quiz 1 Requirements: Web Development Pipeline
This should be a rails application, not a plain HTML page.
The web application has a page with static content on it.
The web application is hosted on Heroku.
The code for the application is hosted on GitHub.
There is a headline on the page of the application that is a non-black color.
Quiz 2 Requirements: Setting up a Database
Create a model, and database migration for something of your choosing.
Add the SimpleForm gem to your application.
Build a new form for the item.
Bonus (optional) When you press the submit button on the new form have it store the value in the database and show the item on the page.
ðŸ§® Quiz #3
Quiz 3 Requirements: Object-Oriented Programming
Build a class for a Dog, Pony, Mountain, or any real world object you want to represent in code.
The class should take arguments when you build a new instance of it.
The class should store the values that it is initialized with, in its instance variables.
You should use attr_accessor.
ðŸ§® Image Blur #1
Image Blur 1 Requirements
Build a class that allows us to build a new image with the data we specify. Make it possible for hte class to output the image to the screen. Your goal is to have the following code work:
image = Image.new([
  [0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 0, 0]
])

image.output_image
And when you run that code it will output the following to the terminal window:
0000
0100
0001
0000
ðŸ§® Image Blur #2 and #3
Image Blur 2 Requirements
Given a black and white image, represented as the class you already implemented, implement a blur method to run a tranformation on the image. Running the blur transformation causes any 1 in the image to cause teh pixel to the left, right, and above and below to become a 1.
Image Blur 3 Requirements
Given an image, we want to build a method to blur the image. However, instead of only blurring images that are within 1 pixel, we want to specify how far to blur the pixels that are within a Manhattan Distance of what is specified. In the previous challenge we built a method that will produce the blurring with a Manhattan distance of 1. Build the method def blur (distance) that will implement a blurring of the Manhattan distance specified.
ðŸ§® Linked List #1
Linked List 1 Requirements
Implement a Stack
Reverse the LinkedList using iterative code
ðŸ§® Linked List #2
Linked List 2 Requirements
Reverse the LinkedList using mutation
Build a method to determine if a LinkedList is infinite
ðŸ§® Luhn Algorithm
Luhn Algorithm Requirements
Write a method to determine if a credit card number is valid
Use the tests to make sure your solution is working
ðŸ§® Fibonacci Sequence
Fibonacci Sequence Requirements
Build a recursive method to find the nth digit
Build an iterative method to find the nth digit
Use the Benchmark module to test your solutions' performance
ðŸ§® Collatz Sequence
Collatz Sequence Requirements
Write a method to determine a number's Collatz sequence
Find the number (1 to 1,000,000) with the longest Collatz sequence
ðŸ§® Tree Traversal
Tree Traversal Requirements
Build the tree
Build a method to complete a depth first search
Build a method or methods to complete a breadth first search
ðŸ§® Binary Tree Sort
Binary Tree Sort Requirements
Implement a binary tree (also known as btree) sorting algorithm to sort an array of integers such that the test passes
